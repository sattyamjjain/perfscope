PyCallMeter - The Ultimate Python Performance Profiler & APM Tool 🚀

PyCallMeter is the most advanced Python performance profiler and application
performance monitoring (APM) tool. Get real-time insights into function execution
time, memory consumption, call hierarchies, and bottleneck detection with zero
configuration.

Perfect for:
- Django, Flask, FastAPI web applications
- Async/await and concurrent applications
- Data science and machine learning pipelines
- Production performance monitoring
- Memory leak detection and analysis
- API performance optimization
- Microservices performance tracking

Key Features:
- 🎨 Production-ready logging with [PyCallMeter] identifiers
- 📊 Advanced performance analytics (CPU, memory, call frequency)
- 🔄 Full async/await support for modern Python applications
- 🌳 Interactive call tree visualization in HTML reports
- 💾 Memory leak detection with garbage collection tracking
- 📈 Export reports in HTML, JSON, CSV formats
- ⚡ Minimal overhead (2-5% in production)
- 🎯 Smart filtering and bottleneck detection
- 🔌 Zero runtime dependencies
- 🏭 Enterprise-ready with configurable logging levels

Quick Start:
    >>> from pycallmeter import profile
    >>>
    >>> @profile()
    >>> def your_function():
    ...     # Your code here
    ...     pass
    >>>
    >>> # Automatically generates performance logs and reports!

Advanced Usage:
    >>> @profile(
    ...     trace_memory=True,
    ...     report_path="performance_analysis.html",
    ...     min_duration=0.001  # Only log functions > 1ms
    ... )
    >>> async def process_data(data):
    ...     # Your async code here
    ...     return processed_data
